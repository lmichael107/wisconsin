## Attending

- Anyone interested in learning about the Julia programming language.

## Claudia Solis-Lemus

from [Claudia's web page](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~claudia/):

I am a PhD student in Statistics at UW-Madison working with professor 
Cécile Ané in the inference of phylogenetic networks to represent the 
tree of life expanded by extra hybridization edges. Understanding the 
evolutionary history of species is essential to conservation efforts 
and to discover the tree of life.

I obtained my Master's degree in Mathematics here at UW-Madison with emphasis on probability theory.
I am originally from Mexico City where I did my Undergraduate degrees 
in Actuarial Sciences and Applied Mathematics at ITAM .

## Julia

Claudia will be giving a an overview of the Julia programming language,
followed by group discussion. Faculty member Douglas Bates, who is very
experienced with Julia, will also attend in order to participate in
discussion and answer questions.
